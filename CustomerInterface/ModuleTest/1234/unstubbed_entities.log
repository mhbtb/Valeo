*** This is not an error log ***
The existence of entities in this log does not signify that an error has 
occurred.  The purpose of this log is to provide a reason to you when a 
symbol has not been stubbed by VectorCAST.  When a link error occurs, the 
'Reason Not Stubbed' column provides an explanation.  In certain cases you 
may be required to provide a definition for certain entities in user code.  
Please consult the User's Guide for more information.

MK2L_bit     variable  Entities from non-Search directories are expected to be defined in an external library. If this entity is missing from the harness, specify the appropriate library in the linker options. If you want this entity to be stubbed instead, either specify the directory as a Search directory or add this item to Additional Stubs. However, standard library items should usually not be stubbed.
